## Hello friends! 

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dave and I specialize in building web applications and APIs using Node.js, React and Sanity.

For the content backend, I've used Sanity CMS and MongoDB to flexibly model content as needed for different applications. Sanity provides an intuitive interface for managing content and makes it easy to access via APIs. I containerize my Node servers with Docker for portability. I'm continuing to explore these modern web architectures to build fast, scalable sites and apps.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new things outside of web development, like exploring penetration testing methodologies and researching CVE exploits. My small backyard farm with 10 hens, a rooster named Roscoe, a dog, and a sweet cat provide welcome breaks when I need to reset and recharge.

I started exploring full-stack development in 2018 after taking some excellent online courses from instructors like Colt Steele, Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller, Andrew Mead, and Angela Yu. It's been fun to build projects in areas I'm interested in using the skills I've developed.

Some technologies I've been working with:

- Sanity CMS - For content modeling and management 
- Next.js - For server-side rendering and API routes
- Vercel - For painless CI/CD
- Docker-  For deploying APIs in the cloud with Express
- MongoDB - For flexible document databases

I love how intuitive Sanity makes managing content across sites and applications. The community resources have also been tremendously helpful in learning how to get up and running.


## Happy coding!
